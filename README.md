# Commandments for Edits
1. Thou shalt not neglect semi colons
  * Optional in JS, but more readable for us
2. Thou shalt separate code into blocks notated by comments
3. Thou shalt store commands in a commands directory
  * Optimized organization. Take your Standard JS and shove it.
4. Thou shalt put open curly braces on the same line as conditions or function names
